Compare performance of List implementation with arrays and linked lists using
Java ArrayList and LinkedList data structures.

Tests:

1. Allocation by inserting 1 million random elements.
2. Inserting 10 000 elements in random places.
3. Searching for a 10 000 random elements.
4. Deleting 10 000 random elememnts.
